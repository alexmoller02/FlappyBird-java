- Particle-based blood explosion on collision
- Pause and resume functionality (`ESC`)
- Game Over screen with dynamic stamp animation
- Sound system with:
  - Randomized flap (`whoosh`) sounds
  - Death and falling effects
  - Point sounds on pipe pass

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone or download the repo**
2. **Ensure your IDE is set to Java 17+**
3. **Run `App.java`** as a Java application

---

## 🎨 Controls

| Key       | Action                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `SPACE`   | Flap / Restart after death  |
| `ESC`     | Pause / Resume              |

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- Pure Java (no external libraries)
- Built with `javax.swing` and `java.awt`
- Audio: `javax.sound.sampled`

---

## 💡 Tips

- Place `.wav` files and sprite images under `src/Resources/` using relative paths like `/Resources/Sounds/Point.wav`
- To reduce lag on first flap, preload all sounds using `SoundPlayer.preload()`

---

## 🔧 Customization Ideas

- Add high score tracking
- Add a start screen before gameplay
- Infinite difficulty scaling with more milestones
- Skins/unlockables via score

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project is perfect if you're learning:
- Java game loops and Swing UI
- Object-oriented design in Java
- Manual animation and rendering
- Event-driven sound effects
- Simple game architecture and state management
